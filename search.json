Using variables extracted satellite images, identified six distinct spatial patterns variations building density, land use, street layout. spatial patterns classified using principal component analysis (PCA), followed clustering model. Afterwards, compared accessibility employment considering different modes transportation identified spatial patterns. Results show higher building density spatial patterns exhibit elevated accessibility transportation modes. job accessibility concentrated approximately 10% GGH, posing challenges spatial planners devise transportation system accommodates territorial differences. Statistical analyses confirm significant differences job accessibility among spatial patterns.","code":""},{"path":"https://dias-bruno.github.io/RSAccess/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"A data package to integrate remote sensing variables and job accessibility measures for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) area in  Ontario, Canada","text":"can install development version amazonULC GitHub :","code":"# install.packages(\"devtools\") devtools::install_github(\"dias-bruno/RSAccess\")"},{"path":"https://dias-bruno.github.io/RSAccess/index.html","id":"examples","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"A data package to integrate remote sensing variables and job accessibility measures for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) area in  Ontario, Canada","text":"basic example showing plot map spatial patterns identified Greater Golden Horseshoe area. polygons classified : High Building Density Tree-lined Neighborhoods Medium Building Density Mixed Rural Use Waterfront Housing Farms Rural Neighborhoods  cd . example shows plot map job accessibility (Public transit (peak)).
