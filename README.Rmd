The `RSAccess` integrates variables extracted from remote sensing data
and from a road network database with accessibility measures. The
RSAccess package is a component of the GEO712 course's final project at
the School of Earth, Environment & Society of McMaster University. The
main objective of the final project was to analyze and compare job
accessibility levels across different spatial patterns, focusing on the
Greater Golden Horseshoe area (GGH) in Ontario, Canada.

Using variables extracted from satellite images, we identified six
distinct spatial patterns with variations in building density, land use,
and street layout. The spatial patterns were classified using principal
component analysis (PCA), followed by a clustering model. Afterwards, we
compared accessibility to employment considering different modes of
transportation in the identified spatial patterns. Results show that
higher building density spatial patterns exhibit elevated accessibility
for all transportation modes. The job accessibility is concentrated in
approximately 10% of the GGH, posing challenges for spatial planners to
devise a transportation system that accommodates these territorial
differences. Statistical analyses confirm significant differences in job
accessibility among spatial patterns.

## Installation

You can install the development version of amazonULC from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dias-bruno/RSAccess")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example showing how to plot the map of the spatial
patterns identified in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area. The polygons
were classified into:

1.  *High Building Density*

2.  *Tree-lined Neighborhoods*

3.  *Medium Building Density*

4.  *Mixed Rural Use*

5.  *Waterfront Housing*

6.  *Farms and Rural Neighborhoods*

```{r}
library(RSAccess)
library(ggplot2)

data(grid_sam_classified)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = grid_sam_classified, aes(fill = as.factor(Cluster)), color = NA) +
  labs(fill = "Spatial Patterns") +
  theme_minimal()
```

cd
.


This example shows how to plot a map of job accessibility (Public transit (peak)).

```{r}

data(grid_sam)

ggplot() +

  geom_sf(data = grid_sam, aes(fill = ptp_ac_emp), color = NA) +

  labs(fill = "Job acessibility", title = "Public transit (peak)") +

  theme_minimal()
```

Visualizing the difference in accessibility to work between the clusters using a boxplot, considering public transport (pico) as the mode of transport:

```{r}
boxplot(ptp_ac_emp ~ Cluster, data = grid_sam_classified, xlab = "Spatial patterns", ylab = "Public transit (peak)", outline = FALSE)
```
